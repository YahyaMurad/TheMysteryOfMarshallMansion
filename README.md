# The Mystery Of Marshall Mansion
A repository for the Algorithms Analysis &amp; Design Course (WIA2005) Group Project

Last Christmas, I was invited to the Marshall Mansion by Lashram Rivers, a friend I
had met a few months before at another friend’s wedding party, for a private dinner
since I just moved into the city and had no one to celebrate Thanksgiving with.
Rivers was adopted by Mr Phillip Marshall, the mansion's owner, when he was 8
years old. Mr Marshall is a wealthy businessman who runs several manufacturing
factories all over the US, and Rivers helps manages the business for Marshall.
Close families and friends attended the dinner. Mr Marshall’s children, Jones and
Jenna Marshall, his brother and sister, Peter and Penelope Marshall, his uncle Will
Marshall and several other close friends of the family; around 15 people were eating
at the large dining table that night.
The dinner was wonderful, with plenty of food to eat. But suddenly, in the middle of
the desert, Mr Marshall gasped and fell off his chair. Everyone was panicking, and I
ran to Mr Marshall to see what could be done. A few minutes later, while waiting for
the ambulance, Mr Marshall was not breathing anymore.
